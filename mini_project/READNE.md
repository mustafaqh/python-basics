#  Mini Project â€“ Data Structures, File Processing, and Recursion

This mini project is a collection of Python programs showcasing **data structures, file processing, recursion, and simple object-oriented programming**.  
It integrates fundamental Python concepts into slightly larger tasks than the introductory assignments.

##  Contents

###  Data Structures
- **Deque.py / Deque_main.py**  
  Custom implementation of a **double-ended queue (Deque)** using linked nodes.  
  Supports operations like `add_first`, `add_last`, `remove_first`, `remove_last`, and iteration.

###  Object-Oriented Programming
- **MultiDisplay.py / MultiDisplay_main.py**  
  A class-based program to store a message and repetition count, with methods for displaying and formatting.

###  File Processing & Statistics
- **count_numbers.py** â†’ Count unique integers and their occurrences from input files.  
- **read_numbers.py** â†’ Calculate **mean** and **standard deviation** for lists of integers.  

###  Text Processing
- **find_words.py / findwords_main.py**  
  Extract words from text files, clean them from punctuation/numbers, and save results to an output file.

###  Recursion & Directories
- **print_all_subdirectories.py**  
  Recursively traverse directories, printing files and subfolders while skipping hidden ones.

##  How to Run

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-python-assignments.git
cd my-python-assignments/Mini-Project
```

Run any program, for example:

```bash
python Deque_main.py
python MultiDisplay_main.py
python count_numbers.py
python read_numbers.py
python findwords_main.py
python print_all_subdirectories.py
```

##  Key Learning Outcomes

- Object-Oriented Programming with Python classes (`dataclass`)  
- Implementing custom data structures (Deque)  
- File I/O with large datasets  
- Statistical analysis (mean & standard deviation)  
- Text parsing and cleaning  
- Recursive directory traversal  

---

##  Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- No external libraries required (standard library only)

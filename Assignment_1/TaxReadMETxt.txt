tax.py
 is a program  which reads a (positive) monthly income from the keyboard and then prints the corresponding income tax.
In simplified version of the Swedish income tax system we have three tax levels depending on your monthly salary:
You pay a 30% tax on all income below 38.000 SEK/month
You pay an additional 5% tax on all income in the interval 38.000 SEK/month to 50.000 SEK/month
You pay an additional 5% tax on all income above 50.000 SEK/month

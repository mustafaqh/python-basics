#  Assignment 1 â€“ Python Fundamentals

This assignment contains **introductory Python programs** that demonstrate the basics of input/output, conditionals, arithmetic, and logic.  
Each program solves a small but clear problem, helping to build a foundation in Python programming.

  Reads a monthly salary and calculates the Swedish income tax.  
  - 30% tax on income < 38,000 SEK  
  - 35% tax on income between 38,000â€“50,000 SEK  
  - 40% tax on income above 50,000 SEK  

- **change.py**
